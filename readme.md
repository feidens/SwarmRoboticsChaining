# Swarm robotics project: Chaining and exploration

* github: feidens



## How to start

* There two different source lua files
* The first one is srprojectnormal.lua
* It is for the experiment with normal P_chain as discussed in the report
* The second is srprojectlow
* It is for the experiment with low P_chain as also discussed in the report
* The lua files are loaded with argos3 and can be run with the landmarks.xml file


## Important
* Notice that we developed the lua controller with beta 10 of argos 3
* The same holds for the landmarks.xml file. It is the one provides in SS 2013
